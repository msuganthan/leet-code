/**
 * 5194. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-276/problems/minimum-moves-to-reach-target-score/
 *
 * You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer 1 and you want to reach the integer target.
 *
 * In one move, you can either:
 *
 * Increment the current integer by one (i.e., x = x + 1).
 * Double the current integer (i.e., x = 2 * x).
 * You can use the increment operation any number of times, however, you can only use the double operation at
 * most maxDoubles times.
 *
 * Given the two integers target and maxDoubles, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach target
 * starting with 1.
